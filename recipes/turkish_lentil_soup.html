    <h1>Turkish Lentil Soup</h1>
    <img src="images/turkish-lentil-soup-recipe-7.jpg">
    <h2>Turkish red lentil soup, or mercimek çorbası, is creamy and full of nutrients!</h2>
     <p>Red lentils breakdown and soften easily during the the cooking process, 
        which is how you get the creamy texture in this Turkish soup without the added fat. 
        When I need to throw together a quick and healthy dinner, red lentils are one of my go-tos. 
        Fast-cooking and delicious, these tiny legumes are a good source of both <a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/lentils/">protein and fiber.</a> 
        They absorb seasonings easily, so there’s no limit to the different flavors I can play with. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Extra Vergin Olive oil</li>
        <li>Aromatics: Chopped yellow onion and garlic</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Carrots, tomato paste, and a russet potato. I like including a potato because it acts as a natural thickener, 
            adding to the velvety texture of the lentil soup once you blend it. If you prefer soup that’s not as thick, you can leave it out. </li>
        <li>Broth: Low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth both work well. To make this recipe vegan, use vegetable broth.</li>
        <li>Spices: Aleppo pepper, cumin, and coriander for heat and earthiness.</li>
        <li>Red lentils: Pick through and rinse the lentils before adding them to the broth.</li>
        <li>Lemon: I love squeezing some lemon juice over my soup to instantly brighten it, especially when the soup has deep flavors like this one. </li>  
     </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Saute the vegetables and aromatics. Heat 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a large cooking pot over medium heat. 
            Add 1 chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, 2 to 3 chopped carrots, and 1 chopped russet potato. 
            Season with a generous dash of kosher salt and cook until the veggies have softened, which will take 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Then add the tomato paste and stir to coat everything.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, spices, and lentils. Pour in 6 cups of low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, then add 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, 
            1 teaspoon cumin, and ½ teaspoon coriander. Add 1 cup red lentils and stir. </li>
        <li>Cook the soup. Let the soup boil for 4 to 5 minutes, then lower the heat to a very gentle simmer and let it cook for 15 to 20 minutes. 
            Put the lid on the pot but leave a small opening. Stir occasionally, and if the soup is getting too thick, add more broth. </li>
        <li>Blend the lentil soup. Once the lentils are tender, remove the pot from the heat and carefully blend with an immersion blender until smooth. </li>
        <li>Warm some extra virgin olive oil. Add 3 tablespoons EVOO to a small skillet over medium heat. 
            Add 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper and 1 clove minced garlic and cook briefly, until the garlic is golden and the oil looks a bit red from the Aleppo pepper. 
            Pour the oil over the top of the soup to immediately add richness. </li>
        <li>Serve. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges on the side. I love squeezing a good amount of lemon juice over my soup before I dig in. </li>
     </ol>
